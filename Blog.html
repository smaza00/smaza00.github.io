        <p>School work Sunday.. yay..<br>
        <br>
        Let's see. What have I accomplished..? I finished my cookbook, started this blog, and finished what I was told to in yearbook.
        Yearbook literally took forever because it was the index. If people added stuff to the index I don't even know. I'd literally
        be working on it a lot longer. It was easy and I don't mind doing it. Just took forever. Computer science work was fine also took awhile.
        I guess my fault for getting distracted and trying to make it look good. I wanted to make something I somewhat liked though so I'm okay with how 
        long it took. It does look pretty nice. This blog is a lot of words. I might go and add pictures. I don't know yet. If I do 
        I can post a picture of my notecard in biology or something. like that. Speaking of biology, I straightened my hair for my presentation.
        It is still a little straight but not that much. Could be better, but could be worse. My hair has never been straight for long once I straighten it.
        Someone whose name I won't mention because I've already mentioned him a lot used to tease me about my hair not staying straight. I mean it doesn't 
        but it kinda stays straight. Hopefully it looks decent tomorrow. </p>

        <p>Happy Saturday! <br>
        <br>
        It was a pretty slow going. I'll take it though, slower day means longer til Monday. I have multiple
        presentations. One being after school and the clay for cancer. I'm nervous because I have no idea how to
        present it. I mean we made a script and practiced it like twice, but I don't remember part of my part.
        I remember all of it except about the healthy cell division. I always get lost on the steps in Interphase
        like the G1, S, and G2 stages. G2 is the one with the most happening and I think S is where DNA replicates?
        Probably not. I did not make any progress in my cookbook. Instead I played Pokemon Sword wonder trade
        and hoped for Pokemon I don't have. I didn't get them. I need shield exclusives (and a few trade evolutions) then
        I'll complete the Poxedex. Literally I have like 383 out of 400. Then when the expansion pack comes out, I'll
        probably never be this close again. I looked at the exclusives for the expansion pack.. Why does shield get 
        the cool pseudo legendary pokemon? Like come on Gible and Beldum are cool but I have to wonder trade for them.
        Anyway enough with my Pokemon rant, I didn't really work on much school work because I wanted a break from school.
        That's what a weekend is supposed to be (for the students at least). Guess I'll have to finish it tomorrow
        which is far better then doing it Saturday. Why? I don't know cause why not.

        <p>Friday partyyy!!<br>
        <br>
        School was fine. Really rude awakening have a 2-hour delay, no school, then waking up at 7. Like come on I like sleeping.
        School was fine as I mentioned before, until I got to yearbook. Literally my 'friends' stress me out a lot. Oh well with working on the index 
        I can listen to music and do my own thing. Computer Science was fine. I talked to Landon a bit and probably said something mean, actually I don't think I did.
        I just asked why he kept looking at me. And said I had a better cookbook then him (I did for the record.) I ended up knocking out a quite a bit of the cookbook.
        However, I broke my program and Mr. Fender (my teacher) had to help me because I broke the top bar. It had the text on opposite ends and bullet points. It was a chaotic mess.
        Now it is fixed and doesn't look too atrocious. Now it's blue with pink text. I'm not huge on pink, but it goes well together. Whoever is reading this blog I apologize with how random
        it is, but it's actually fun writing it. I'm able to do my assignment, while saying what I've been thinking (for the most part). Will someone see 
        this, most likely no except my teacher, but I kinda want to continue making a blog for everyday (well at least once a week.) It's fun to make and like I said
        it's something I can just type away on and let go of what I have been thinking. On a more random note I made boxed brownies. Definitely don't compare to my homemade ones.

        By far one of the best school day's ever!! Why? Because we didn't go. <br>
        <br>
        I was supposed to go to robotics (probably argue or get along with Landon who knows) but that is irrelevant!
        I got to sleep in until about 8-9:30, around that time. I didn't start E-learning until 10:30, because the email I got said
        E-learning was at 10, so I waited an extra half hour :). I did math first because it was literally taking notes for ten minutes.
        Literally, one of the easiest things ever. Then, I worked on English. Was I terrified of it. Yes. Did I always fail those types of assignments. Apparently not
        because I got 100% even though I usually get a 4 out of 10 on those assignments. I worked on biology after which was finishing a script. I then took a break. Why I don't know.
        It was literally like 11:30 when I took a break. After my lunch break that I really didn't need, I worked sign language. Frankly I was like 10% behind. It's okay I'm caught up now.
        After my sign language I was done with E-learning (that was due the next day) I worked on my computer science cookbook by finishing 1 recipe. Then I literally worked on yearbook the rest of the day.
        Lots of breaks included because what I was working on (the index) was literally taking me hours. Not 1, not 2, not 3, but hours. I don't know how many but it was a lot. Then that concluded my day.
        I also watched some Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. (don't judge it's literally my favorite Pokemon series.) Well day = done!

        Yay!! We had a 2-hour delay! <br>
        <br>
        Shorter day, didn't have as much to do, assignments were moved back, all around pretty good.
        Wednesday, Wednesday, what else happened. Hmm. I don't remember. English, history whatever the heck it's called was fine.
        We practiced for our trial which is soon and kinda scares me. I get an easier part in a way not really, so who knows.
        Biology same old same old. Not the best not the worst. In sign language my teacher had me work on yearbook.
        In yearbook I worked on yearbook. In computer science I worked on my cookbook (literally took forever) and probably argued with Landon.
        Happens on a daily it seems. Oh well we kinda get along kinda don't. He can be fine if he wants to be. Other times he literally wants to be annoying.
        If he doesn't help me with my comments after I helped him (I don't even remember what I helped him with) I'm actually going to sue him. 
        Anyways, after computer science I went to math. I actually like math and we're learning something random. What is it? I have no clue. 
        I do know how to do it, just not what it is. When I went home I don't remember. Like I have no clue what happened. I remembered school, but not my home life.
        Go me *facepalms*

        Welcome to my first blog entry! <br>
        <br>
        Do I know what I'm doing yet? Not really. Will I stay up to date? Probably not. Will I try? Yeah why not. Will I forget? Probably. <br>
        I'll be honest I'm making this Sunday night (March 1st). Do I remember what I did on the 26th? Not really. Looking back at my notebook the 26th wasn't that good.
        It was a pretty stressful day. With learning computer science.. I think we started this project along with the recipe book project. 
        Like I said I don't really remember, I just remember not having a very good day. I believe it was this day I literally went insane. We were taught some CSS stuff (I remember this day now)
        and did I get it? no. But that is irrelevant. Not really. We learned about the CSS style sheet, after understanding it, it made my life a lot easier with coding. 
        After learning about the CSS style sheet and before I literally went crazy. i don't even know why. Like I even scared Cameron C. which is an accomplishment since he always says I'm not scary.
        I calmed down and started my cookbook. Yay cookbooks. I did get to paint a cool looking picture though. It's supposed to be a galaxy.
        Is it? Kinda not really, but still it's cool looking.
