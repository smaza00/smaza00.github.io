        <p>Mixed up Wednesday <br>
        <br>
        Just found out I messed up the dates. Oh well. I fixed it no worries. Morning was trash. 5th hour - 8th hour was okay.
        It just took awhile. 5th I went and walked around with a girl to take photos (we got yelled at whoops.)
        We talked to someone in the lunch detention because we needed one of them to get their picture but apparently that's not allowed. 
        Then I worked on something in yearbook. Went okay. Computer science we talked about Rob being in a toxic relationship with Tanya (ethical vs not ethical computer things)
        In math I learned math. Weird I know.

        I picked out the grade calculator and started filling out the paper. I also started planning on what 
        I wanted to add to my calculator.

        <p>Long Day Tuesday..<br>
        <br>
        Hi guys. Today was a long day I'll be honest for the most part it was okay. English was long and so was biology.
        In sign language I tried selling some ads and tried working on the index. Then during the actual class me and my partner, Cadence,
        looked for pictures to include in the index. Our editor, Helen however was having a difficult time making it to where the pictures fit on the side.
        She isn't too happy about the design and neither are me and Cadence. Our teacher thought that it was a great idea resulting in us doing it.
        She said the original plan everyone liked was too difficult, but the now design is also very difficult because there isn't enough room. Computer science
        was okay too. I helped Cameron because that boy struggles wayy too much in the class. Me and Cam annoyed our teacher it was pretty fun.
        I started feeling bad in math where my stomach was hurting, I had a pounding headache, and overall just didn't feel too good. We had time to work
        on the homework that due tonight. I'm not done but I'm close. It's something strange. It's not too difficult though. I went home took my temperature
        found out I'm not sick. I feel okay now after about 4 hours. Oh yeah I forgot I said hi to my new best friend.
        I actually called him new best friend and he responded. He's probably going to get annoyed, but I'll stop calling him best friend.
        We have to go to my computer science class during advisory now to work on AP computer science, so maybe me and Logan will actually become good friends.
        Wish me luck!
        </p>
        <h3> AP Computer Science March 3rd, 2020 </h3>
        <p>Alright so I didn't have time to actually work on my packet. I do have an idea for both of the programs I might want to use. 
        I'll start filling out the paper tomorrow during advisory. My plan is to actually start planning out how everything will be done
        or ya know fill out the paper one of the 2. Maybe I'll do both. Who really knows. </p>

        <p>None-stop Monday..<br>
        <br>
        Like literally none stop. English we listen to a trial forever.. Mine's later on in the week if the trials ae as long as todays.
        Biology I practiced for my presentation. I literally did good practicing, since I didn't use my notecard, but I got a C. Why? I don't know.
        I presented good, the only thing I can think of is that I wasn't watching presentations the whole time. Literally it was an hour and I had been to 
        the presentations.. Twice, and I was taking pictures for a class then deleting the ones I didn't like. I asked permission before. 
        If the reason was that then I guess I got a C on my project. Really not fair with how much I contributed but I guess whatever. Not only that, but 
        I presented something I wasn't supposed to because one of my group members wasn't there and I really didn't use the notecard. I stood the whole hour and stayed with my group.
        I don't understand how I could lose points for doing what I was supposed to.. and doing it well.
        In sign language I worked with people on yearbook which was actually kinda fun. I worked on yearbook with one of them too during yearbook. In computer
        science I had to change the way my website looked, I wasn't a huge fan about that. Everything is one font then this is a different font. The fonts 
        are similar though so I'll live. Oh this is off topic, but during the Clay for Cancer presentations my parents thought I had a boyfriend or that I liked my friend because he was talking to me.
        He's super hyper and literally talks none stop, but we're good friends. Some people find him weird and annoying but he's one of my good friends
        so I'm fine with his on going rambling. However, I had to explain to my parents that boy and friend had a little space indicating the friend zone. 
        Someone also saw me there and quickly looked away because I'm that disliked. They were an adult too. I'm 15 they could act a little more then age.
        Back on topic kinda. Fixed my website, started adding comments (hate it), and helped someone with there website. (They ignored me after because I'm
        'mean' but were good friends soo.) After computer science I went to math and learned my fractions in fractions (I don't remember the actual name of the lesson.)
        Pretty easy, but then after school was AP computer science. Literally made a new 'best' friend. Well Mr. Fender made him my best friend.
        My new 'best' friend's name is Logan. He was supposed to text me to help me with pokemon trading.. but he never did. He's already untrustable. (I'm kidding)
        Then we discussed about robotics changes and I was told I couldn't date Logan (wasn't planning on it) reason for that is it's already awkward with me and Landon.
        After me complaining about Landon and people in one of my classes, that's when Mr. Fender told me I needed new friends. Hence why Logan is my new 'best' friend.
        Sorry Logan you'll be hearing my complaints possibly tomorrow about my biology presentation. Anyway I'm going to add a small section for what I need to include in this blog. 
        Whoops lots of rambling.
        </p>
        <h3> AP Computer Science March 2nd, 2020 </h3>
        <p> Well... Today I accomplished picking two programs I might want to improve. The programs is one being
        a lottery ticket generator or a calculator. I feel the like the calculator is easier, but the ticket generator would give me more of a reward.
        I might make both and see which one I actually can make decent. I'm thinking of going through and making both (depending on time) and see which one I like better.
        I'll probably start with the calculator because I know I will for a fact get that one done. If I can't improve it then I literally need to change my life decisions..
        Tomorrow or the next day (depends on time I have) I'll probably fill out my paper thing I got about the create task. If I absolutely despise it then I'll start 
        adding more to my calculator I made. </p>

        <p>School work Sunday.. yay..<br>
        <br>
        <p>Let's see. What have I accomplished..? I finished my cookbook, started this blog, and finished what I was told to in yearbook.
        Yearbook literally took forever because it was the index. If people added stuff to the index I don't even know. I'd literally
        be working on it a lot longer. It was easy and I don't mind doing it. Just took forever. Computer science work was fine also took awhile.
        I guess my fault for getting distracted and trying to make it look good. I wanted to make something I somewhat liked though so I'm okay with how 
        long it took. It does look pretty nice. This blog is a lot of words. I might go and add pictures. I don't know yet. If I do 
        I can post a picture of my notecard in biology or something. like that. Speaking of biology, I straightened my hair for my presentation.
        It is still a little straight but not that much. Could be better, but could be worse. My hair has never been straight for long once I straighten it.
        Someone whose name I won't mention because I've already mentioned him a lot used to tease me about my hair not staying straight. I mean it doesn't 
        but it kinda stays straight. Hopefully it looks decent tomorrow. </p>

        <p>Happy Saturday! <br>
        <br>
        It was a pretty slow going. I'll take it though, slower day means longer til Monday. I have multiple
        presentations. One being after school and the clay for cancer. I'm nervous because I have no idea how to
        present it. I mean we made a script and practiced it like twice, but I don't remember part of my part.
        I remember all of it except about the healthy cell division. I always get lost on the steps in Interphase
        like the G1, S, and G2 stages. G2 is the one with the most happening and I think S is where DNA replicates?
        Probably not. I did not make any progress in my cookbook. Instead I played Pokemon Sword wonder trade
        and hoped for Pokemon I don't have. I didn't get them. I need shield exclusives (and a few trade evolutions) then
        I'll complete the Poxedex. Literally I have like 383 out of 400. Then when the expansion pack comes out, I'll
        probably never be this close again. I looked at the exclusives for the expansion pack.. Why does shield get 
        the cool pseudo legendary pokemon? Like come on Gible and Beldum are cool but I have to wonder trade for them.
        Anyway enough with my Pokemon rant, I didn't really work on much school work because I wanted a break from school.
        That's what a weekend is supposed to be (for the students at least). Guess I'll have to finish it tomorrow
        which is far better then doing it Saturday. Why? I don't know cause why not.

        <p>Friday partyyy!!<br>
        <br>
        School was fine. Really rude awakening have a 2-hour delay, no school, then waking up at 7. Like come on I like sleeping.
        School was fine as I mentioned before, until I got to yearbook. Literally my 'friends' stress me out a lot. Oh well with working on the index 
        I can listen to music and do my own thing. Computer Science was fine. I talked to Landon a bit and probably said something mean, actually I don't think I did.
        I just asked why he kept looking at me. And said I had a better cookbook then him (I did for the record.) I ended up knocking out a quite a bit of the cookbook.
        However, I broke my program and Mr. Fender (my teacher) had to help me because I broke the top bar. It had the text on opposite ends and bullet points. It was a chaotic mess.
        Now it is fixed and doesn't look too atrocious. Now it's blue with pink text. I'm not huge on pink, but it goes well together. Whoever is reading this blog I apologize with how random
        it is, but it's actually fun writing it. I'm able to do my assignment, while saying what I've been thinking (for the most part). Will someone see 
        this, most likely no except my teacher, but I kinda want to continue making a blog for everyday (well at least once a week.) It's fun to make and like I said
        it's something I can just type away on and let go of what I have been thinking. On a more random note I made boxed brownies. Definitely don't compare to my homemade ones.

        By far one of the best school day's ever!! Why? Because we didn't go. <br>
        <br>
        I was supposed to go to robotics (probably argue or get along with Landon who knows) but that is irrelevant!
        I got to sleep in until about 8-9:30, around that time. I didn't start E-learning until 10:30, because the email I got said
        E-learning was at 10, so I waited an extra half hour :). I did math first because it was literally taking notes for ten minutes.
        Literally, one of the easiest things ever. Then, I worked on English. Was I terrified of it. Yes. Did I always fail those types of assignments. Apparently not
        because I got 100% even though I usually get a 4 out of 10 on those assignments. I worked on biology after which was finishing a script. I then took a break. Why I don't know.
        It was literally like 11:30 when I took a break. After my lunch break that I really didn't need, I worked sign language. Frankly I was like 10% behind. It's okay I'm caught up now.
        After my sign language I was done with E-learning (that was due the next day) I worked on my computer science cookbook by finishing 1 recipe. Then I literally worked on yearbook the rest of the day.
        Lots of breaks included because what I was working on (the index) was literally taking me hours. Not 1, not 2, not 3, but hours. I don't know how many but it was a lot. Then that concluded my day.
        I also watched some Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. (don't judge it's literally my favorite Pokemon series.) Well day = done!

        <p>
        Yay!! We had a 2-hour delay! <br>
        <br>
        Shorter day, didn't have as much to do, assignments were moved back, all around pretty good.
        Wednesday, Wednesday, what else happened. Hmm. I don't remember. English, history whatever the heck it's called was fine.
        We practiced for our trial which is soon and kinda scares me. I get an easier part in a way not really, so who knows.
        Biology same old same old. Not the best not the worst. In sign language my teacher had me work on yearbook.
        In yearbook I worked on yearbook. In computer science I worked on my cookbook (literally took forever) and probably argued with Landon.
        Happens on a daily it seems. Oh well we kinda get along kinda don't. He can be fine if he wants to be. Other times he literally wants to be annoying.
        If he doesn't help me with my comments after I helped him (I don't even remember what I helped him with) I'm actually going to sue him. 
        Anyways, after computer science I went to math. I actually like math and we're learning something random. What is it? I have no clue. 
        I do know how to do it, just not what it is. When I went home I don't remember. Like I have no clue what happened. I remembered school, but not my home life.
        Go me *facepalms*

        Welcome to my first blog entry! <br>
        <br>
        Do I know what I'm doing yet? Not really. Will I stay up to date? Probably not. Will I try? Yeah why not. Will I forget? Probably. <br>
        I'll be honest I'm making this Sunday night (March 1st). Do I remember what I did on the 26th? Not really. Looking back at my notebook the 26th wasn't that good.
        It was a pretty stressful day. With learning computer science.. I think we started this project along with the recipe book project. 
        Like I said I don't really remember, I just remember not having a very good day. I believe it was this day I literally went insane. We were taught some CSS stuff (I remember this day now)
        and did I get it? no. But that is irrelevant. Not really. We learned about the CSS style sheet, after understanding it, it made my life a lot easier with coding. 
        After learning about the CSS style sheet and before I literally went crazy. i don't even know why. Like I even scared Cameron C. which is an accomplishment since he always says I'm not scary.
        I calmed down and started my cookbook. Yay cookbooks. I did get to paint a cool looking picture though. It's supposed to be a galaxy.
        Is it? Kinda not really, but still it's cool looking.
