				A fun place to visit is Florida. I love going there and I've been lucky enough to go multiple times. 
				There's a ton of fun places to visit such as the beach, aquarium, and Disney World. Each place has been fun to visit.

				The Beach
				</h2>
				The last time me and my family went to Florida was about 2 years ago. We went a day or so after the last day of school. 
				We drove down and met my grandparents there. We all ended up staying on a <em>beach </em>by the ocean. It was a lot of fun and we stayed for about a week.
				My grandparents bought a camera that allows us to take pictures under the water of the different animals. I was able to take a few pictures of fish under the water.
				My brother and sister found it very interesting and took a bunch of photos as well. <strong>Unfortunately, </strong>I don't have the pictures since they are stuck on the camera and it's kinda lost now.
				Some days the waves were super crazy. <strong>Luckily,</strong> the little cabin thing we were staying at also had a pool. When the waves were too crazy for all of us we just hung out at the pool or drove to town and explored.
				My sister also had very bad sunburn and we ended up having to avoid the ocean even more so it didn't get infected. Which was upsetting to haven't of went to the ocean as much, but good for my sister since her sunburn was a huge bubble.
				My family did end up having a lot of fun despite some of the bad thing such as the huge waves. The waves were pretty fun to stand in though, until it was too dangerous. <br>

				The Aquarium
				</h2>
				When I was last in Florida as I mentioned before we drove to town to explore a bit.
				One of the places was an <em>aquarium</em>. While there I saw, so many different animals. 
				There were <strong> <em>seahorses, turtles, otters, and so much more</strong></em>. The aquarium was broken down interestingly as well.
				There were different areas some like a museum, some underwater, and some over exhibits. There were a lot of different animals that were all very interesting to see.
				My favorite was either the sea turtles or the otters. While there they also had a souvenir shop. I got an otter stuffed animal because of how interesting I find otters.
				They also had different statues, like there was one of a seahorse and one of a dolphin.

				Disney World
				</h2>
				The last time I ended up going to Disney World was quite a while ago. I believe the last time I ended up going was with my family and my grandparents.
				We went during the Halloween Party. We watched the show performance with the <strong>Hocus Pocus</strong> cast. Hocus Pocus is one of my favorite Halloween movies,
				along with the Nightmare Before Christmas. Oogey Boogey along with other Disney Villains made an appearance in the show.
				Me and my siblings all dressed up in different costumes. The last year we went <em>I dressed as Stitch from Lilo and Stitch</em>. 
				Not only did we go to the Halloween Party and watch the show performance, but we tried pretty good food and went on some pretty fun rides.
				We were also able to meet different characters. They also had some pretty cool places to visit within the parks. I remember one year, 
				I'm not sure which year, but my family and I went on a ride where you had a good chance of being splashed with water. Where me and my 
				grandpa were sitting at the beginning we didn't get any water on us. However the longer the ride went the more drenched we got.
				It was a bit annoying walking around all drenched, but I'm pretty sure it started pouring rain right after. It did end up being a lot of fun overall.<br>
